# STM32-Projects
A collection of my STM32 projects.

STM32 Projects Repository
Introduction
Welcome to my STM32 Projects Repository! This repository is a collection of various projects I've undertaken while learning and exploring the STM32 platform and embedded systems in general. The projects range from simple experiments to more complex applications, each aimed at understanding different aspects of STM32 microcontrollers and embedded system design.

Repository Contents
In this repository, you'll find a variety of STM32 projects, including:

I use STM32F401RE Nucleo board

Basic GPIO Control: Projects involving basic GPIO operations, such as controlling LEDs, reading button states, etc.
UART Communication: Examples demonstrating UART serial communication, including simple echo programs and more complex data handling.
Sensor Integration: Projects integrating different sensors with STM32 boards to measure and process various physical quantities.
PWM and Timers: Examples utilizing PWM signals and timers for applications like motor control.
[Additional project categories based on your work]
Each project folder contains all necessary source files, schematics (if applicable), and a dedicated README with detailed information about the project, including its purpose, hardware requirements, setup, and usage instructions.
